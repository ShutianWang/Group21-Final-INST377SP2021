          <p> It’s somewhat well known that music types vary in popularity over time, however, the overarching trends presented by certain ranking systems are not 
            always well identified or communicated with the average listener or artists. Our app will retrieve extensive information on music that entered Billboard’s 
            top 100 over the years, and create different visualizations that will highlight some trends that may or may not have existed in what qualities are associated 
            with more successful music/ artists. We believe that this could aid many artists in their attempts to make innovative, creative, or just successful music as 
            our trends would communicate what qualities have proven successful in the past. This information could also help those writing music for other forms of media 
            such as Movies or TV shows find direction when writing scores that either aim to appeal to current music trends or aim to replicate a period's sound. 
            For example, if someone wanted to write music for a period piece about the 2000s, they could investigate some of the trends that existed in music during that 
            time period using our application and gain a better understanding of how their music should sound to accomplish what they want it to accomplish. </p>
