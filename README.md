# Music Database

## Description
The music industry is a competitive one, and there is often more to it than just luck. Being able to easily navigate through a collection of information on recent music that has proven to be successful could allow those trying to break into the industry to those looking to maintain their position to see what has worked in the past and learn from it. Our database provides information on the music and artists that have made it to the Billboard Top 100 in the previous years, and allows viewers to navigate through this data.
